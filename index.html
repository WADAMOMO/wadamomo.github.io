	<h1>Hi I'm William Adamowicz!</h1>
	<p>This is a page where I am logging my daily activity through the process of going from knowing not a single thing about programming to becoming a professional software developer. I actually started a little bit before 2018, having completed Colt Steele's Web Dev course on Udemy, and having done the HTML, CSS, and Javascript intro stuff on CodeAcademy and FreeCodeCamp. All in all, I would say that's maybe 30 useful hours of work, since I ended up not retaining any of the stuff that happens at the end of the Colt Steele course. If you are reading this and are just starting out and don't know where to go from here, I would definitely recommend starting with <a href="watchandcode.com">Gordon Zhu's Watch and Code</a>. I definitely have a long way to go, but I'm also for the first time in my life really dedicating myself to something wholeheartedly, and I think I'll be able to accomplish this by the end of the year and hopefully land a job where I'm working on something I enjoy doing. </p>

	<p>If you have any questions you can click the email button down here and it will pop up a window, just like that. And I built that just a couple weeks ago. In fact, if you navigate to the blog page up top, you'll find out how I built this entire page in about an hour or so using a Github pages Jekyll tutorial. If you're also going down the developer path, you should definitely make one too! It's proved to be a very helpful tool in terms of planning and holding myself accountable for daily upates. Since I was also never the type to blog, it's also taken me out of my comfort zone. Initially, it felt very self-involved and weird. But the more you just write whatever you think and make plans for the day, the more natural it gets. So if you, like me, think it's a little weird to talk to yourself everyday, this is me telling you that you're right, because it is weird, but it's also really helpful, and everyone does it for a reason, so blog away, I certainly won't judge you.</p>
