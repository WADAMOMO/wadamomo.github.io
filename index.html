	<h1>Hi there, I'm William Adamowicz!</h1>
	<p>This is a page where I am logging my daily activity through the process of going from Hello World to professional programmer. It will probably not be interesting to anyone except if I become really successful (even just vaguely successful, I'll settle for) and inspire someone else to follow a similar path. If you have any questions I am fully prepared to give you an unprepared opinion on the matter.</p>
