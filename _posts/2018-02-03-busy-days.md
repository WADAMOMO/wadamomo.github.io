Day full of activities. Still completed the two katas for the day and finished doing the Wes Bos course in the AM but still have yet to start doing the Hack Reactor prep module 2. Went to Kokedera and Katsura rikyu so it's a bit of an off day as well. Same plan tomorrow. Definitely did as much as possible though given the time constraints so I can't complain.
