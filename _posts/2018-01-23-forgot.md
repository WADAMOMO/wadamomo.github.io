I forgot to post again, we'll see if it works again. So as of now it says on my github profile that I have no contributions for the 22nd or the 23rd. It is now the morning of the 23rd in Japan. AH I figured it out! Maybe because it's still the 22nd in America? We'll see. I will try to first push this post and then I'll push the one after. Or actually you know what I'm going to make the date 23rd on this one. And then I will post the 22nd one afterwards.
