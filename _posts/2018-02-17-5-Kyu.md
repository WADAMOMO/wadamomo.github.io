I'm sleeping like a newborn baby of late which confusing and also throwing off my entire morning. Like 8:30 hours in a single shot. Which is unheard of. At any rate moving through these new katas is going ok today minus the fact that I have 15 minutes before work. Forgot about lastIndexOf... not the most useful but I guess it can come in handy for these kinds of things.

Doing 2 wes bos' later to make up for yesterday. And redoing Mod 1 and Mod 2 from HR prep. Somehow forgot to push again. I don't know what's wrong with me. Just do it every day!!!
