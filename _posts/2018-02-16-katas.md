Fucking Caesar Cipher just slayed me.
Kept trying to modulo 13 instead of doing mod 26 like a doofus. Had the right approach though. get char code, subtract 65, add offset, mod 26, add to 65. I made that a lot more complicated than it had to be.

TOMORROW. Busy day at work so need to do the max possible in the AM.
2 new katas.
2 wes bos.
HR module 2 and the tougher problems from 1.

3 old katas.
