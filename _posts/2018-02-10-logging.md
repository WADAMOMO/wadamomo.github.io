I believe I skipped WesBos both today and yesterday so I will have to play a little catch up in the morning. Good thing I anticipated losing track of time and went ahead a couple lectures.

It has not been easy of late and I feel like I may have purchased watch and code in vain but I hope that doesn't end up being the case. I really need to finish the HR prep. The good news is I think I'm 90 percent of the way there. The bad news is I now want to also get into codesmith and I haven't started any of their prep work. But when WesBos and HR are over at the end of the month I'll have a lot more time on my hands. If I can knock off the FCC and start doing CodeSmith that would really be the cherry on top.

Tomorrow just do wesbos in the morning. If you finish that do the final problem on HR Mod 2 and start reviewing all the toy problems. If you finish that, which you won't, but in the off chance that you do, then do a little watch and code.
