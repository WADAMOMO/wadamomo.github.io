I feel ded inside just feed me to the beasts. Have to make tacos for 20 people on wednesday and the whole pride of mexico and america rests on impressing a bunch of japanese people who know nothing about mexican food.

Fuckloads of wes bos to catch up on. Did not do FCC. And have to finish CSX and Mod 3.

I'm not drinking anything until march 9th. At which point if I get into codesmith I will consume my body weight in liquor.
