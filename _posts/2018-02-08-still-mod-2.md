Working through the fashion inventory problems, which are actually a lot more difficult than they seem. I completed inventory B all on my own which was nice, but my code was much longer than expected. Just started to get used to, for example, calling a function with another function passed in as the parameter which still feels very unnatural to me, despite the obvious appeal of its looking very clean. Like so: \n
thisFunction(thisOtherFunction) {
  // other stuff here
}
\n
Also interesting that the functional programming style creates basically this totally empty shell through which you pass all this data. But all the variables really don't represent anything on their own. Their just placeholders for different modifications of the data that you eventually pass through this flow. It's a totally different style of coding than anything you learn on FCC or CodeAcademy. And it seems like a very important part of learning how to code more efficiently.

Going to finish up refactoring fashion inventory and then doing a wes bos and doing two katas if I don't collapse.
