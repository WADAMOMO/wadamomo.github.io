There are just too many resources to learn how to code. That's a fact. And there is the question of improving one's skills doing algorithm scripting challenges through FCC or Codewars vs deepening one's knowledge through tutorials and videos. For example. Recursion is still a bit of a mystery. It's fine when I'm doing the factorial problem on FCC or basic examples but I have to admit my grasp of how it works is a bit like watching inception. It's cool and everyone can understand the basic idea but when I look under the hood to figure out how it's all put together I basically have no fucking clue how any of it makes any sense whatsoever.

So here is what I'm deciding for the rest of this month. I'm going to strictly do algorithms in the mornings from the moment I wake up until my 8:30 ish breakfast. And then do algorithms while allowing for asides until I have to go work. So allowing the occasional video tutorial on higher order functions while I'm practicing. The afternoons and evenings will always be reserved for Practical JS and CS50 which despite not being on every single list of how to code out there seems like a good way to really nail down the basics. It definitely gets you up to speed and I would be impressed if someone coding for the first time would be able to complete the check credit problem all on their own within that first week. Of course, there probably are a bunch of people doing just that. I guess that's why it's taught at Harvard... to all those overachieving little bastards.
