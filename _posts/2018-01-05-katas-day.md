Trying to get 10 katas done today on codewars to get into a rhythm. Am currently at 6 kyu. I will also get week 0 CS50's HW done. 

 It's 7:30 AM and I just finished the divisors problem. Very frustratingly an error kept being throw divisors(...).join is not a function. In the comments someone suggested adding this to the end of your code:

 String.prototype.join = () => true

 This fixed the problem.
