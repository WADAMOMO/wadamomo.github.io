There are too many things going on:

-I made the executive decision to stop CS50 for now. Re-starting at this point is a bad idea since there will be too much time wasted. I think this was not a bad decision, and I will learn the theory in the camp anyway. Have to stick with it, as disappointing as it is.

-I also stopped FCC front end. However, I think this is one that I should absolutely finish.

-I paid for WatchAndCode premium and haven't used it at all, but next month I'll make up for that, so it's fine. Plus he deserves my money. I think 80 will be reasonable. 120 may be pushing it.

-I will finish Wes Bos' course.

-I will finish HR prep and sign up for an interview ASAP

-I will finish FCC Front End
