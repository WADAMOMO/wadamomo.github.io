title: "***** BLOG POST [2] â€” Second Month Summary *****"

At times it will feel like nothing is getting done, because so many things are happening at the same time. In these moments it's best to regroup, think for a second about the plan, and then just methodically implement that plan going forward. There's nothing else to do.


This month the priorities were to complete Wes Bos, FCC Front End, and HR Prep. As I'm writing this, Wes Bos is on track, HR Prep is on track, but FCC is not, so that's the priority. As I'm writing this on Feb 20th, FCC is way behind.

The routine should be implemented like a piece of code.

Step 1: do 1 new kata, and 3 old katas, first thing in the morning.
Step 2: if Wes Bos is not on track, do the missing courses
Step 3: do 1 HR prep interview exercise per day, there are exactly 7
Step 4: do one FCC Front End project, there are 7 left
Step 5: do some CSX Prep

The plan for next month:
-higher order functions reactive
-node school
-watch and code premium
-build chrome extensions and learn react
