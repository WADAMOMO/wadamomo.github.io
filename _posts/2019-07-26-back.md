We're back. You've learned a lot over the last year and you accomplished what you wanted to. You have, however, strayed far from the righteous path in these last months. You are not disciplined. You are fucking about. You are of course getting stuff done, by external standards, anyone would agree you've been doing fine. But you're not trying to measure up to your friends's kind standards of what it means to be getting by just fine. You are measuring yourself against yourself. You need to be more proactive in the mornings. Don't make excuses for yourself. Get work done, and do this daily posting. DO THE DAILY LOG, it is important.

Things to think about:

Building a react-native iPhone layer interface so you can quit your fucking job and make music

Piano lessons in the AM

Keep writing Pharmacological Investigations

You must throw yourself away to be an artist
