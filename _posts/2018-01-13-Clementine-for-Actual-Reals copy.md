Starting clementine now. But for real this time.

Also I spent a full two hours, give or take, trying to return arr.indexOf(arr[i]) instead of just.......... i. And since indexOf returns by default the FIRST INSTANCE of whatever appears it kept returning the first value without me realizing that it was returning that value and I kept trying to no avail to fix the code even though all I had to do was return i the whole time instead of trying to return the index of the element like a fucking moron. IF nothing else, I know that I will never make the same mistake again.
