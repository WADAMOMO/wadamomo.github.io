So it's actually January 24th today but I realized that no one will ever read all of the posts that I write since they're incredibly boring. However, what might be more useful to aspiring coders would be a monthly log of all the things I did and all the things I learned each month. I think a lot of people do a kind of here-is-everything-I-learned-in-9-months kind of posts, but those often cover so much ground that you lose sight of the little details. So I figured it would be good to start cataloguing in advance of the end of the month, when I will edit this post and make it look all nice and shiny.


Things I did:
-Made this blog using this Jekyll tutorial here
-Installed homebrew to help with installations here
-Completed Gordon Zhu's excellent Javascript Tutorial here
-Got through #### katas on Codewars and leveled up to 5 kyu
-Completed #### weeks of CS50
-Completed FCC front end
