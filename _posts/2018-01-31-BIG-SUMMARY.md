Welcome to my first monthly summary. It is currently 10:40 PM on the 31st and I have an interview with Thinkful in the morning at 7:30 Japan time, so I'll try to keep this short. Here are the things I did this month:


Things I did:
-Made this Github pages blog using <a>this Jekyll tutorial</a>
-Created an SSH key to avoid having to type the password over when pushing code to Github
-Installed homebrew to help with package installations and updates, which helped when I got 'Object.values is not a function' because I didn't have the new version of node installed, for example
-Completed Gordon Zhu's excellent Javascript Tutorial and will go on to do his premium content, if only to donate 40 dollars and contribute to his progress
-Leveled up to 5 kyu on Codewars
-Completed 3 weeks of CS50
-Completed Module 1 of Hack Reactor Prep


Things I did unrelated to code:
-Started developing a concept for an 'AirBnB of food' — a concept that has been much attempted, but so far I have yet to see something real come to life
-Gave a lecture on the difference between American and Japanese culture at Doshisha University
-Started journaling a daily log of my activities, yes, like some kind of sociopath, but also, hey you know what when you've had intense periods of depression you do whatever the fuck it takes so get off my back


The plan for next month:
-Wes Bos's 30 day course
-Finishing FreeCodeCamp Front End
