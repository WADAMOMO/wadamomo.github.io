title: "BLOG POST [1] — First Month Summary ***********************************"
date: 2018-01-31

Welcome to my first monthly summary. It is currently 10:40 PM on the 31st and I have an interview with Thinkful in the morning at 7:30 Japan time, so I'll try to keep this short. The main takeaway for the month is probably from Gordon Zhu's course (which is why I've put it up top) when he says that the most important thing is to focus on your practice. Maybe that's not verbatim but the point is, it was all about not jumping around and just sticking with something if you started it. That being said I think you also need to be open to flexibility if you end up starting something that feels ridiculous. So on the one hand you want to make sure that you don't work on something that feels like a waste of time for hours and hours, on the other hand you want to make sure you just stick with one resource if you've started working on it. Here are the things I did this month:
<br>
<br>
<br>
Code-related things: <br>
-Completed Gordon Zhu's excellent <a href="watchandcode.com">Javascript Tutorial<a/> and will go on to do his premium content, if only to donate 40 dollars and contribute to his cause
<br>
-Went against all my better instincts and created a FreeCodeCamp Kyoto Group and a Meetup to—sorry, just let me vomit in my mouth quickly—be part of a community <br>
-Made this Github pages blog using <a>this Jekyll tutorial</a> to catalog my daily progress throughout this—deep breath—journey
<br>
-Created an SSH key to avoid having to type my username and password when pushing code to Github, for example when I push the code for these daily blog posts, instructions can be found <a href="">here</a>
<br>
-Installed homebrew to help with package installations and updates, which helped when I got 'Object.values is not a function' because I didn't have the new version of node installed, for example
<br>
-Leveled up to 5 kyu on Codewars
<br>
-Completed 3 weeks of CS50
<br>
-Completed all the toy problems in Module 1 of Hack Reactor Prep
<br>
<br>
<br>
The plan for next month: <br>
-Wes Bos's 30 day course <br>
-Finishing FreeCodeCamp Front End <br>
