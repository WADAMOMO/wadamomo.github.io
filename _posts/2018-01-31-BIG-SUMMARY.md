Welcome to my first monthly summary. It is currently 10:40 PM on the 31st and I have an interview with Thinkful in the morning at 7:30 Japan time, so I'll try to keep this short. Here are the things I did this month:
<br>
<br>
<br>
Code-related things: <br>
-Completed Gordon Zhu's excellent <a href="watchandcode.com">Javascript Tutorial<a/> and will go on to do his premium content, if only to donate 40 dollars and contribute to his cause
<br>
-Went against all my better instincts and created a FreeCodeCamp Kyoto Group and a Meetup to—sorry, just let me vomit in my mouth quickly—be part of a community <br>
-Made this Github pages blog using <a>this Jekyll tutorial</a> to catalog my daily progress throughout this—deep breath—journey
<br>
-Created an SSH key to avoid having to type my username and password when pushing code to Github, for example when I push the code for these daily blog posts, instructions can be found <a href="">here</a>
<br>
-Installed homebrew to help with package installations and updates, which helped when I got 'Object.values is not a function' because I didn't have the new version of node installed, for example
<br>
-Leveled up to 5 kyu on Codewars
<br>
-Completed 3 weeks of CS50
<br>
-Completed all the toy problems in Module 1 of Hack Reactor Prep
<br>
<br>
<br>
The plan for next month: <br>
-Wes Bos's 30 day course <br>
-Finishing FreeCodeCamp Front End
