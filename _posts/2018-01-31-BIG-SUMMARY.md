title: "BLOG POST #1 — FIRST MONTH SUMMARY"
date: 2018-01-31

it's actually January 24th today but I realized that no one will ever read all of the posts that I write since they're incredibly boring. However, what might be more useful to aspiring coders would be a monthly log of all the things I did and all the things I learned each month. I think a lot of people do a kind of here-is-everything-I-learned-in-9-months kind of posts, but those often cover so much ground that you lose sight of the little details. So I figured it would be good to start cataloguing in advance of the end of the month, when I will edit this post and make it look all nice and shiny.


Things I did:
-Made this blog using this Jekyll tutorial here <br>
-Created an SSH key to avoid having to type the password over and over with Github help pages here <br>
-Installed homebrew (here) to help with package installations and updates for example when I got Object.values is not a function because I didn't have the new version of node installed <br>
-Completed Gordon Zhu's excellent Javascript Tutorial here
-Got through #### katas on Codewars and leveled up to 5 kyu
-Completed #### weeks of CS50
-Completed FCC front end

This might seem like a lot. In fairness I had already done Colt Steele's bootcamp, done 5-6 courses on CodeAcademy, and done all the HTML, CSS, and JS stuff on FreeCodeCamp, so all I had left was the Algorithm Scripting and the Projects for the Front End.

I think next month I will tackle WesBos's course, and in fact I've already started because February is short!


Things I did unrelated to code:
-Started developing a concept for an 'AirBnB of food' — which has been much attempted, but so far, to no avail
-Cooked a lot of things
-Started journaling a daily log of my activities, yes, like some kind of sociopath, but also, hey you know what when you've had intense periods of depression you do whatever the fuck it takes so get off my back
-GOT THE PICTURE TAKEN - be a person - join the world
-rewatched this interview and decided to take James Murphy's advice and 'engage culture' instead of being a jaded dick
