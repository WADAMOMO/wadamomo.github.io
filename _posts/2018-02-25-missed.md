I honestly sometimes think I'm losing my mind. I could have sworn I made a post yesterday. I would easily have bet 100 dollars if you'd asked me last night if I'd made a post earlier that day. And clearly I would have lost 100 dollars. I'm also still weirdly suspicious even though there's clearly no evidence. I need to sleep more.
