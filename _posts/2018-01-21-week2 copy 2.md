Working through Week 2 of CS50. The question with these challenges is always how much do you look up how to do the thing you're trying to do. Like am I supposed to just go ahead and hardcode all the values for the musical notes or is there a better way of doing it? And if I can't think of a better way of doing it (which I can't) then is it just giving up if I look up an answer to get help. It is. So I have to go ahead and hard code is the unfortunate answer.

I created a meetup and the FB page for freecodecamp and will go to the first meeting tomorrow, we'll see how it goes!
