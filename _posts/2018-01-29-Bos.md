I've gone through the first 100 of the HR prep problems. They are proving pretty easy but I'm sure the next two modules will be more challenging and I will surely have to polish up some more. For now the main thing to focus on is the exceptions on certain problems. Some as to return undefined, some ask to return 0. Also making sure that the callbacks always take a return statement. Also making sure that reduce always has an initial value. Just found out from the MDN doc that you can use reduce to set up a count object and declare that object in the same line which is slightly shorter than the way I was doing it by setting up the empty object and then using a forEach or a map function.

Next on the agenda is finish WesBos day 1.
Hopefully also finish the rest of the Git Immersion tutorial by the end of the day.

If I have time on my hands after all that try to do another 22 of the HR problems.
