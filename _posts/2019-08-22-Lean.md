Write.

Lean into the darker sides of the your desires.

You do not want to be seen as a one trick pony, so you want to download another book to the kindle since you talked Solal's ear off about Wittgenstein the other night. This is fine. Not the most beautiful thought, but an imperfection that you do not need to run away from. Stop giving any fucks what anyone else thinks.
