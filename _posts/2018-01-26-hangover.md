I am hungover. Wow that is lot of curse words what is wrong with me. It's 5:30 and I feel like a crab. 

I don' even remember what I was about to type. Alright. Going to do my katas.



Just spent 30 minutes trying to go back to a previous commit and make that the new head using git reset hard. Makes no fucking sense. No one explains git properly anywhere. I hate stack overflow. I hate you so much. I love you. But I hate you. line breaks were not working with the br tag. <br> and i guess now they are?
