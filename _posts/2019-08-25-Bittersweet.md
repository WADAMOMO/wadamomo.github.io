Many things to do today. Do them at your own pace. Find balance. 
Accept your own beauty, let it shine, accept your own faults, let them be, love yourself, accept yourself.
Lean into everything.

Schedule things to do every single day. Schedule things to do every single weekend. If you don't get to them you don't get to them, but have things to do.
You are at your best when you engage people, when you engage culture. You are at your worst when you hide, when you are left pining for what you don't have, when you fantasize.

But the energy towards:

Piano lessons
Masterclass
Surfing
