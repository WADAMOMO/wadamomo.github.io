It should never be difficult getting up in the morning.

There are bigger battles out there.

You managed to get up almost as if it were automatic today, despite the fact that you were mid-cycle.

With enough motivation the impossible becomes possible. Getting out of bed hardly falls into that category. It should always be a breeze. Don't make it harder than it has to be.
