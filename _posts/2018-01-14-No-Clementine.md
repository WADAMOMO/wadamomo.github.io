Experienced. Heavy. Heavy delays. 

I decided to start doing this Clementine JS thing without really knowing what I was getting myself into but decided to go forward with it any way and pretty soon I was downloading homebrew and installing mongoDB. Except it would only download if I had the latest version of XCode installed from the App Store. So I tried to get that but I could only download XCode if I upgraded to MacOS High Sierra. So I did that. And that basically fucked all my shit up. Just ruined everything. Ended up spending the entire morning trying to figure out why Microsoft Word would insta-crash when I tried to open it and why all my files were getting deleted. Now it looks like a bunch of plug ins on Ableton won't work anymore. And it turns out I changed my mind about doing the Clementine JS tutorial because you end up getting to it anyway in the FCC Back End Cert. So I ended up having to spend three hours of my day just trying to get Word to open until I gave up uninstalled all of Office and downloaded a cracked version from the Pirate Bay. I'm not proud of that but I also got office when I was in school for free and now no longer have access which is BS. So I'm not not proud either. Also known as not ashamed. At any rate. The plan is go back to doing FCC and just get this damn front end cert finished. Do all the algorithms on FCC and do the damn portfolio page and just get it done by the end of January. If Shawn Wang can do it you can do it. You have two weeks. Also turn in your CS50 homework. GO!

I just found this nice Medium article about applying to Hack Reactor and I decided I'm just going to go through this list. My goal is to get into a top level bootcamp as quickly as possible so that I can start moving by April. 2 months of non stop daily coding should be enough to really get a decent grasp of JS.
