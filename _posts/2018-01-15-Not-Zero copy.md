Got coffee with a friend today and tutored in the morning and woke up at 6 instead of the usual 4:45 ish so it was a late start and I ended up talking for hours with this person unexpetedly so I got very little done. That being said it was not a zero day. In fact I ended up getting a FCC intermediate scripting challenge done and also built the FCC Kyoto page on FB. But I forgot to commit my changes!!!!!! So there's an open square on my github which is annoying but it's whatever. The important thing is. No Zero Days. For now sticking with the new plan from the medium article I found yesterday.
