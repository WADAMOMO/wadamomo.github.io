"Five years ago, what were you doing?"

I don't know why it took me so long to answer, but I imagine it has something to do with the fact that I still feel uneasy about having lived in my parents' house and flaunting it as if I was Walden on the pond. 

_'Woe is me, life was difficult and lonely.' Yes, it may very well have been, but there's no need to use that as a way to make yourself look good._

Something to that effect is at play.

The truth is, I was living like a spoiled brat. Living in our 'country house'. A house purchased with laundered money, rebuilt to look extravagant, but with no one to live in it. Ultimately, it became rotten. The house has no soul, and it's foundations are crumbling at the hands of its owner who carries on in the pursuit of something ephemeral. That my father has been grasping at straws to make himself complete comes as no surprise, now. It has logical cohesion. The perfect alignment of a dovetail joint.

The vestiges of that dependence will always remain, and yet there are actionable steps I can take. Remove the subscriptions, pay your own phone bill, cut the credit card in half. What else is there to do?
