Finish redoing HR prep mod 2. Get up to 21 in Wes Bos. Then redo mod2 again and record yourself doing the answers. Review all the crap. Then do mod3 tomorrow!

Wonder how I will deal with the optional Advanced FCC Algorithm Scripting Challenges. Would be interesting to try to finish that by the end of the month so I can feel like I at least finished one thing this month instead of feeling like I started 80 and finished none T_T
