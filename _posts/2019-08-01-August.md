August is the cruelest month the fucker had no idea what he was talking about. Do a bit of yoga today. Worked a bit on music. And that's all you need. Be grateful for the days. Be grateful for everything you have. As Chris would say, we made it.

Go on vacation. Take a break. Regroup. And have yourself a good time.
