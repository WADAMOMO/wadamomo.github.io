So I've edited this post a fair amount since I started cataloging my daily progress. I've gotten a surprising amount done in the last month but I will save most of the details for the first summary.
<br>
<br>
Since I'm really only—for now at least—using this site to track my own progress, it is mostly a tool for my benefit. However, in the off chance that someone ends up reading this, I will try to make it presentable so that you, dear person, can also learn and grow or whatever. I also decided a few weeks later (i.e. later, since I am now rewriting this from the future) that it would be much more beneficial to do one month summaries. This seems to me to strike a balance between all the articles and listicles out there about '10 things I did to learn how to code in one year' and the ones like this where there's just daily incomprehensible nonsense. Since most of the daily posts will be incredibly boring to other people, the monthly summary will be more detailed than the year long format, and it will also be a nice way for me to closely consider how much progress I'm making per month.
<br>
<br>
I got the idea to create a page like this a little while back when I was just doing research on bootcamps. I started looking at the LinkedIn profiles of bootcamp grads from different camps. Eventually I found Viking Code School and <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/stephen-mayeux-shows-you-what-9-months-of-self-taught-coding-looks-like-50f4e6c3598f">this post</a> written by Stephen Mayeux which follows a certain pattern that I found on a bunch of other posts, including this <a href="https://sw-yx.github.io/2017/12/19/fcc-blogpost-draft-2">other one</a> which is incidentally the one that helped me put together this blog. The pattern is basically, I tried to teach myself coding, learned a lot but realized I wasn't moving fast enough, am applying to a bootcamp to accelerate the process.

I'll maybe make a few more changes to this post as the year goes on so I'm going to drop it for now and just focus on putting together a nice summary for post number 1.
