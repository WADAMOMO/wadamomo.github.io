Yes. Devout anti-blogger since the first days of the blog is no longer being a grumpy old person and is leaning in to technology. I am putting together a site that tracks daily progress because I have need some more structured accountability in my life. So I'm talking to myself. If anyone ever reads this, just know that it was really for my eyes only. But also hi, I guess. 

I built this page using this <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">Jekyll tutorial</a>. It seems to be a good way to do the daily tracking blog thing while also using git every day and, taking a page from Shawn Wang's book, not having any 'Zero Days' i.e., where you don't do anything at all. His post, as with Haseeb Qureshi's story (also pulled from Shawn's webiste), are both very inspirational, and I recommend you read as many of these as possible if you, like me, are venturing into the unfamiliar territory of all things code.
