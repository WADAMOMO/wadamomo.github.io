Just doing one kata today.  

I am giving a guest philosophy lecture at Doshisha University in a week and I have no prepared anything and it's stressing me out a little so I'm going to piece something together so I'm not completely useless when the time comes. Am going to start working more seriously on the CS50 game in the evening time.
