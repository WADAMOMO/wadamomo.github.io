You're going away for a little bit. To clear your head. Use this time wisely. Enjoy yourself. You have nothing else to do on this planet ever. Forget your dreams and live. And figure out what happens afterwards. Don't think too hard about being productive, or using something for one thing or another. Enjoy your time on this earth.
