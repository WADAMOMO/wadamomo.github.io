Want to have CSX completely done by the time I interview.

Also want to complete HR, only 3 more problems left, and want to do those in the house, so I will finish that before I leave today.

Then CSX.
Then do half of remaining WesBos.
Then finish. Stupid. FCC. If you have time. At least do the stupid weather thing.
