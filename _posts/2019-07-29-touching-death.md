Took 400mg of modafinil yesterday and got extreme suicidal thoughts. The experience has proved positive all in all, as it has made me realize where I'd been faltering. Afraid, in a way, as that old boy Jordan pointed out to me just now. It feels as though things could be in reach, and all the ingredients for success are there.

Put the writing on hold and focus on your music. Write music. Think music. Breathe music. The things you want to say will come out in the work your produce. Keep writing these posts. They foster your sense of well being and they allow your voice to emerge.

This is good.
