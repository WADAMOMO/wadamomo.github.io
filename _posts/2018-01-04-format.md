layout: post

So was apparently naming the posts wrong. The file name was only the date with the extension .md but was supposed to have the date hyphen something as per the jekyll guide. So don't make the same mistakes as me. Name your files 2018-01-04-SOMETHING.md and not just the date else the layout won't be able to parse the title. In fairness the Jekyll tutorial says: "Jekyll is very strict with how these files are named, so pay attention. It must follow the convention"

So now that I fixed all the file names for the last 3 days they should all upload. Fingers crossed.
