I am finishing all the crap that I did not finish last month unfortunately. But I'm close. I have 2 more Wes Bos videos. Finished the hack reactor prep. And have 2 more units of CSX. I think I can get it all done in the next few hours if I don't dick around too much. Maybe tomorrow. Finally I have to do a little bit of FCC but that's not the priority let's be honest.
