Bit of a feeble attempt honestly the last two days on here.

I suppose this is a good pratice. Or it was for a while. At least insomuch as I was able to catalogue my daily progress when I was learning how to code.

If nothing else, this will at least keep my on track for learning Flutter.

Yesterday, I mostly watched videos, tonight I will attmpt to at least code out the next challenge app so I'm not just idly watching and I can actually get used to doing more stuff in Android studio.

Running on 6 hours and struggling. Will try to get to the DMV tomorrow with Jayre first thing in the morning.
