The last two days have been very busy so I haven't been able to get much done. Trying to mainly wrap my head around the FCC smallest common multiple answers. I keep trying to understand what's going on in the basic answer but it's not working out for me. Also the intermediate and advanced answers implement the Euclidian Algorithm which I really don't feel like reading about but it looks like it's oging to be inevitable.
