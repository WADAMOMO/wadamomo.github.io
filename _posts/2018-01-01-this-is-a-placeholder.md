Although setting up this page initially was fine, understanding how git works is a separate issue. Thankfully it's starting to come together through some Googling and the help of this how to not fuck up your files with git <a href="https://medium.com/@francesco.agnoletto/how-to-not-f-up-your-local-files-with-git-part-1-e0756c88fd3c">guide</a>. I would highly recommend the most basic tutorial called Try Git, if you just type that into google it will all start making no sense for you, just like it has for everyone else I'm sure. It's starting to click. I think. It's clicking. Probably.
