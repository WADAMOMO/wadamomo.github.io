Although setting up this page initially was fine, understanding how git works is a separate issue. Thankfully it's starting to come together through some Googling and the help of this 'how to not fuck up your files with git <a href="https://medium.com/@francesco.agnoletto/how-to-not-f-up-your-local-files-with-git-part-1-e0756c88fd3c">guide</a>. I would highly recommend the most basic tutorial called Try Git, if you just type that into google it will all start making no sense for you, just like it has for everyone else I'm sure. It's starting to click. I think. It's clicking. Probably.

So I'm just making a note here to summarize the issues I had in the first few days creating this blog and to also warn you that every single post on here will be incredibly boring EXCEPT for the posts in all caps at the end of each month which will specifically be written with an eye towards helping other aspiring developers get started, which I remember being a very confusing time, a time which I am still very much in, but just clawing onwards because that's the only thing there is to do in these situations.
