Still inching onwards. I've had a few .001 days this week which is not good so I will try to fix that tonight. I do have to move countries so I'm going to cut myself a little slack because there's a lot of packing going on. So that explains the slow days, but it's necessary! Must do better, after all I'm paying 40 dollars for this months W&C so I have to use it... else I will lose it.
