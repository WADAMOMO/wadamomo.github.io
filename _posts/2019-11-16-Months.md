There is no shortage of time to make a difference.
This week you will reset, you will go to bed every night knowing you've done your absolute maximum.
You will manage to still go out with someone and still get up at an ungodly hour.
6:30, every day, no compromises.

Use your reminders list and go through them every day.

Schedule your week ahead of time. Schedule it now.

First, silence.
