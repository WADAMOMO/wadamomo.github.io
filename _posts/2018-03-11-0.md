I am in horrible shape. And this will be my first zero day of 2018. I have some stomach problem and it's really fucking up my tonsils and I played tennis all day and I'm going to bed. I tried to do this stupid goddamn chingu challenge problem on hackerrank and even though I pass 2 of the tests it fails on all the others. Unlike codewars it gives you no explanation for why and how the tests are failing and a bunch of them are timing out. I hate this site. This is. Regretably. A zero day. Tomorrow the meetup, so I will work extra hard then.
