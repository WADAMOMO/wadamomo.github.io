Did two katas this morning and will work on the CS50 game for the rest of the day. Will try to catch up so that each week of the year matches each week of CS50. AT LEAST. Hopefully faster.

I 'remixed' the version of the pikachu game. Not particularly proud of this work but honestly coding on scratch seems like a good exercise for people who have never been introduced to anything that has to do with programming. If you're familiar with the basic concepts (what an object is, what an array is, what a loop is, etc.) I don't think it's all that important to create an innovative scratch app. That being said, the logic implemented on these games is impressive. There's a lot going on and it would definitely take a significant amount of time and effort to invent a new game on this platform. At the moment that's not my priority since my eyes are set on applying to the top bootcamps and therefore just honing my skills by going through all the level 7 katas. I've gotten to the point where I can return a few of the level 7 katas on the first try (I think twice now, that's happened), and my answer has also been the top choice. Baby steps. Lots of baby steps.
