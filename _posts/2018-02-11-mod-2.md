Finished Mod 2, now the key is to go back and redo all the Mod 1 and Mod 2 problems again. I think I will start by immediately redoing Mod 2 and then moving back to the toy problems and approaching them in a functional style, and doing them as if it were interview prep.

For now, three days of wes bos to catch up on? It's the 11th today, so I should at least be up to video 13 if I want to finish by the end of this short little month. I think we need to acknowledge more often how weird it is that February is shorter than all the other more. Like every day someone should mention it at least four to six times.
