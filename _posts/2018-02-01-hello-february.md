27 years old and still consistently misspelling the word February. It's just a tricky bastard.

I'm going to put this list <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/blog/10-questions-you-should-be-asking-in-your-code-school-interview">here</a> since I will start interviewing to other camps as well and it seems useful.

The plan today is to do 2 of Wes Bos' tutorials and to move forwards with FCC Front End because I wanted to finish that last month and never got the chance.

I will move over from Codewars to CoderByte since it seems more suited to the HR curriculum and I want to have the best possible chance of getting in, and start doing two of those per day to start things off.

That should keep me busy. Realistically I want to finish FCC front end in the next 2 weeks, the advanced projects look like they take forever though, so we'll see.
