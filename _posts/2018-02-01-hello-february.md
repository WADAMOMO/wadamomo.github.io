I'm going to go ahead and say today was not an all time low but I could not sleep and felt like absolute garbage and could not exercise or shower before I had to go to work this morning. Went for a run after work and managed to salvage why I could doing 2 katas and making up for yesterday's missed Wes Bos day. Back to one day ahead of schedule. I'm going to keep doing my two katas a day because that's the best resource I have at the moment and I don't want to hop around and I think it's actually a solid place to keep working. Made some progress on the FCC page as well I need to finish those stupid projects they're really looming over me. If I ever write a Medium article let it be known that guides on how to go about completing the FCC challenges without A) feeling like a complete failure or B) cheating, will be the first thing on the agenda.

2 katas.
1 Wes Bos.
Start HR Module 2.
That's the plan in the AM.
