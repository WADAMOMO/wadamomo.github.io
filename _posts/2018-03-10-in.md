Will be attending Codesmith's next April cohort. Will continue the daily posting since the learning never ends, and I want to keep growing, and dreams and other inspirational corn. Speaking of which, I made corn tortillas from scratch last month for a bunch of Japanese people. [insert beautiful image of me showing a lady in a kimono how to fry up a tortilla] Goal for the month is to figure out how to embed and format an image so it shows up. I should also maybe eventually start considering making this entire blog look a little more professional. Should at least invest a full day in that before the end of the month.
