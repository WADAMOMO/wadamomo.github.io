When doing difficult closure problems the important thing to keep in mind is that a variable will always store the return value. So it will not run the function that is stored in it every single time. It will run that function, get the return value, and store the return value inside the variable. When you read through the code, all you care about is what's being returned when tying to figure out what the variable refers to.
