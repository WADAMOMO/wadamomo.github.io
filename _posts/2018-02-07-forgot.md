Got a 5 kyu kata done this morning. Took about 30 minutes but it worked and I celebrated. It's not a huge accomplishment but it did make me feel special. Now I get to look a nice solution that's even cleaner than mine and erase all my hard work, but still felt good. Going to try to finish the wes bos that I missed yesterday.
