Barely used watch and code premium and renewing today so decided whether or not I should cancel. I thought the intro was really good though so I think I will stick with it, even if I get in to HR or CS then I need to do something for the rest of the month and it seems like a good segue to start building my own stuff.

Have one day before technical interviews. Plan today is to just redo one of the fashion inventory exercises and some of the Mod 3 stuff on HR prep and maybe try finishing up the CSX extension stuff. Trying to come up with another idea for an extension to build myself but it seems like most good ideas are taken unfortunately. Could be interesting to try and make something that would adjust the audio with the video on youtube and would be useful for the CS website. There is an extension already but it doesn't work properly apparently so I will look into it!
