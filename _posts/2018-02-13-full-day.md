Did all the things yesterday. Except for pushing to the blog page. I need to start doing this as soon as I get up in the morning so that I don't keep forgetting. Felt sickly last night so had to get some extra zzz's but I have all day today to work so here's the plan.

Finished 3 old katas and 1 new kata this morning, and will do that every morning.
Re-did Fashion Inventory A.


DO THE QUOTE GENERATOR TODAY. Just do it. At least that much. That's all you gotta focus on. Work on getting projects 80% done and just moving on.

Then start CSX.

Re-do fashion inventory B, C, and D.

Watch and Code.
