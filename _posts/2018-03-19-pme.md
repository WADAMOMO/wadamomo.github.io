Continued with W&C will maybe start looking at CS50 again if there is time. Am currently in the process of moving countries and planning on attending Codesmith next month so it will be difficult to get much done in the next few days but I will try to do at least one W&C video per day so as to avoid more of those dreaded zero days.
