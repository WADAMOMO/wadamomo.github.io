Finished the reactivex.io exercises. Got a little crazy at the end there, not entirely sure I grasped all of what was happening. Then again that's the story of every online course ever.

Discovered regex101 while doing the validate US phone numbers challenge this AM. Extremely useful! Perhaps, one day, I too will be one of those regex ninjas that roam those coding challenge websites.

Plan for the day is to re-practice some of the module 2 exercises while filming. Finish doing the chrome extension stuff even though it's not really cooperating with me.
