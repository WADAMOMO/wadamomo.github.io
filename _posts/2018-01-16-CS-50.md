I'm going to keep moving through Gordon Zhu's practical Javascript videos and try to finish the CS50 project so I'm back on track. Zhu's videos seem important since they teach beginners how to immediately start building stuff with JS instead of just becoming adept at the algorithms, which is really all I've done so far. Between that, CS50, and the front end FCC projects that should keep me occupied for the rest of the month.
