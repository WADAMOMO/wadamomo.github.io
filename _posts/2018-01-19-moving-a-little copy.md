This has been a very distracted time. For some reason it feels like I'm trying to get as much as humanly possible and not procrastinating much and yet not getting as much done as I would like to. Need to ship the FCC page in the AM and just do a couple katas and watch the CS50 week 2 vids so I can start doing that work as well. Need to start getting up earlier this 5 o'clock shit is not cutting it.

2 katas. Ship the profile page.
