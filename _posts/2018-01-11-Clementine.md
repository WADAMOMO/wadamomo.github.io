Completed a few level 7 katas and moved on to the 6s, which are proving a touch too difficult. Some of them I get on the first try, others (like the morsecode one) I really struggled. I've decided to instead sort all the level 6 and 7 katas in terms of popularity and just working my way down the list so I get a combination of both. Going to do one more and then start doing work on Clementine.JS

Also planning on shipping the Scratch game and watching the Week 1 video so I can turn in my HW by the 14th and be back on schedule.
