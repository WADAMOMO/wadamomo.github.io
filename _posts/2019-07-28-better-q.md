Need to get better quality sleep, maybe reading on the sofa is better so that I sleep right away in bed instead of reading in bed. Taking a break today, maybe do a little bit of writing and set up the studio while shen shen is at her tarot reading.

I was off by a day because I'm an idiot.

Need to get some things done:
  -Buy flights for portugal
  -Get in touch with Mamie to figure out dates
  -Change flight to London
  -Get accodomodations in Worcester

Bought Live 10 cleaned up the studio, did good work this weekend, need to start working with Push 2. I feel like I'm forgetting something major but maybe not? Also do some Pharmacological Investigations writing, maybe the into post, How Wittgenstein Can Help Us Understand Psychedelics...? Something to that effect.

Maybe the categorical mistakes that we make in thinking that our thoughts are somehow altered.

There has to be some kind of work done in the way in which we categorize the process better than just 'it fucks you up'
