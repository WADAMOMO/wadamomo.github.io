I'm desperately trying not to have zero days but I'm on antibiotics and have a virus and it's really ruining my day. And had to work til late. And friend from out of town. I don't even really know who I'm currently listing all these excuses for. I guess future me? Will look back and feel slightly less disappointed? Or more understanding for the lack of progress. Who knows. Watching watch and code premium then bedtime.
