Hmmm. Interestingly it did not update for the 22nd this time but for the 23rd. Maybe it was something to do with the date of the post. Or I hallucinated? Let's see if this now counts as a contribution for the 22nd or the 23rd. 

At any rate nothing much happened yesterday. I realized I never did the work for 'Week 1 continued' of CS50 which is both a little annoying but also somewhat heartening since I thought Week 2 was way too difficult and felt totally at a loss. So perhaps doing a week's worth of extra work will help get me back on track a little bit. Anyway let's see if this pushes to 22nd more importantly.
