Forgot to post today (now yesterday) but nothing too amazing happened, still working through mod 2 and trying to figure out how .prototype is supposed to work. It's kind of shitty that there's no explanation before the exercise anywhere but I guess that's what stack overflow and MDN are for.

Did find out about Codesmith which looks very promising. Intense. But promising. They even have a scholarship for graduates from other bootcamps which is just craze. Joining one of their JS the Hard Parts meetings remotely tomorrow morning.
