Back on track. Was very hungover and got up at 5:30. Also very busy day at the restaurant. And a fish exploded in the deep fryer and hot oil splashed me in the face which was the opposite of cool. It's fine. Got the katas done. Moving ahead with HR prep module 2. Surprisingly difficult stuff. And also was not anticipating the strategy they want you to adopt for tackling code interview tests. I really do have to apply by march though so it's now or never. 3 weeks make 'em count. This is, however, the bare minimum. Tomorrow I need to get back on schedule and set a strict 30 minutes per coding exercise else I lose too much time trying to figure out the answer myself. Best to swallow one's pride and just call it when it looks like you wont make further progress. In fact I'm just now remembering that I actually did give up this morning. Or no actually I ended up having to brute force my way to a very inelegant solution. Which is basically the same end result of feeling like I gave up. Maybe slightly less disappointing. But you feel like you cheated yourself more because you knowingly submitted garbage code to get the tests to pass. It's not so important.

Tomorrow. Finish random quote machine. Finish Module 2. You have all day. Take advantage of it.
